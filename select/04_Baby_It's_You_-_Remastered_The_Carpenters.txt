It's not the way you smile that touches my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone, at home I cry over you.
What can I do?, can't help myself.
Cause baby it's you.
You should hear what they say about you. (Cheat cheat)
They say you've never, never, never been true.
Woooh, it doesn't matter what they say.
I'm gonna love you any old way. What can I do?, when it's true.
Don't want nobody.
Woooh, cause baby it's you
Woooh, many, many, many nights go by.
I sit alone, at home I cry over you. What can I do?
Can't help myself.
Cause baby it's you
