Baby it's you

You're here with me now but you're saying
You don't want me any more
You're holding me now but you're saying
You can't see me no no more
You whisper good-bye then cling tighter to me
I can't take no more.

Baby it's you
Who makes me feel the way that you do
You know I can't forget you so soon
Baby it's you.

Runing your fingers through my hair
But saying you care no more
You're kissing my ear with a heart chilling
Breath that you can't no more
Laying beside me with legs all around me
I care no more oh no.

Baby it's you
Who makes me do the things that I do
You know I can't cast aside you so soon
Baby it's you.

Changing the show
Adding dramatics to help love grow
Your heart is your life
Cut it carefully with your knife
Don't leave the world
Stay right here
Don't make don't make anything rough.

Baby it's you
Who makes me feel the way that you do
You know I can't forget you so soon
Baby it's you.

Baby it's you
Who makes me do the things that I do
You know I can't cast aside you so soon
Baby it's you.
Watching the pretty flowers grow
Never again no summer
